Go horseback riding? Come to the historic Centro, where it is mapped but doesnt exist The most funny in accuracy is the pyramid supposedly a few blocks from my rental house

Next problem, related to this is the Near Me function First, the app couldnt find me Instead, it thought I was in a town two hours away and showed me attractions for that town When I dragged the map to the town I am in there was more of the map craziness, but even worse The few locations that were accurately mapped now shifted to within a block or two from my house

Im not sure what the indication is that its reading your heart rate, as the dial moves around and then restarts constantly. Sometimes a blinking heart shows up. The instructions dont explain what the dial and heart icon are for. Keeping my finger in the same location would reveal a heart rate of 85... and then 31.

Watched the video on their website to look at the location of my finger in comparison to theirs--same spot. Its possible that the technique they use to measure the heart rate doesnt work on everyone--thus the vast disparity in ratings for the app. Seems to work for some people and not for others.

I am also unhappy with the iOS version of Evernote using my location as the default new note title instead of doing it like the desktop version does, using my first sentence 

Another new(?) annoyance is Search now ignores which folder you are in Always searching every note in your Evernote history is not efficient If I know a note I am searching for is in a certain folder I should not have to search through search hits from all my other folders Again, working like the desktop version would be better here

621,1369,"Im giving the NFL 12 v3 update three stars largely because its an improvement over the previous version. The in-game display is better organized, and the Scores page is vastly superior to the prior version: you can now see all games for the current week on one screen instead of scrolling through a list. After a modest amount of use, the app appears much more stable.

However, it still needs work in many respects. The scoring summary is gone (so far as I can tell); I often found this helpful when checking up on games that I wasnt following play-by-play. The team leaders appears limited to only 1 QB (passing), 1 player rushing, and 2 receivers, with no apparent way to scroll through players or pull up a full listing. Especially during the preseason games, when teams are running through multiple personnel packages, this is very frustrating--theres no way (for example) to compare the passing stats of the 2 or 3 QBs who have gotten playing time. A more egregious problem is that (at least for the Thursday games in week 2), the teams do not switch properly: checking on the Atlanta vs. Cincinnati game, if I tap on the Atlanta Falcons button, I get the passing stats for A. Dalton; if i tap on the Cincinnati button I see the passing stats for M. Ryan (with the rushing and receiving stats for their teams). Im hoping this is an operator error that will be fixed shortly, but it reflects poorly on the product.

736,208,"Im giving the NFL 12 v3 update three stars largely because its an improvement over the previous version. The in-game display is better organized, and the Scores page is vastly superior to the prior version: you can now see all games for the current week on one screen instead of scrolling through a list. After a modest amount of use, the app appears much more stable.

However, it still needs work in many respects. The scoring summary is gone (so far as I can tell); I often found this helpful when checking up on games that I wasnt following play-by-play. The team leaders appears limited to only 1 QB (passing), 1 player rushing, and 2 receivers, with no apparent way to scroll through players or pull up a full listing. Especially during the preseason games, when teams are running through multiple personnel packages, this is very frustrating--theres no way (for example) to compare the passing stats of the 2 or 3 QBs who have gotten playing time. A more egregious problem is that (at least for the Thursday games in week 2), the teams do not switch properly: checking on the Atlanta vs. Cincinnati game, if I tap on the Atlanta Falcons button, I get the passing stats for A. Dalton; if i tap on the Cincinnati button I see the passing stats for M. Ryan (with the rushing and receiving stats for their teams). Im hoping this is an operator error that will be fixed shortly, but it reflects poorly on the product.

Previous review,
After several months of daily use, and building about 1K pretty intensive notes, I was in the process to put a serious long-term commitment to EN- but Ive had to seriously rethink this after the problems with the last upgrade The problems Ive experienced are not as severe as what others are reporting Mine have been mostly with the iPad 2 version, while the desktop version w MacBook Air has continued to work OK 

On the iPad things have actually improved quite a bit over the past week, in terms of less freezes, when trying to do a search- so for me it is wait and see, to see if EN can get it together The searches have also become less efficient and clunky in all iPad &amp Mac desktop versions I am still working on EN, but will also be on stand-by, and looking for possible alternatives

I dont have many concerns w the new design, as others do-- but I do hope that EN programmers can stay focused on the real issues",PD,dOBHLZKNnQ,2020-01-25,3

Theres not a lot of detail in the information, particularly in details for upcoming days. The forecast is no more specific than a high and low temp and a picture representation of the weather for the entire day. Nevertheless, this isnt meant to be too detailed, and it provides plenty of info for the current time. My biggest complaint is that the app crashes on startup often. Sometimes it will load the second time, sometimes it requires a restart of my iPad 3rd generation.

Ive yet to see another app that can save to 1 bit (though they can be read by most PDF viewers), but given storage size concerns, I dont see why scan apps dont include this as an option.

1859,3134,"///Update///

149 rounds recorded. iPhone 3GS. Battery 70-80% left after rounds. Still no side game tracking but the notes feature works somewhat for that. Finally fivesomes! Sixsomes! THE BEST APP FOR GOLF!

17 rounds under my belt with this app now and still very happy. The new in-app stats (v.1.3) blew me away!  Still waiting for side games (skins, etc.). Im confused why so many golfers leave their phone on the entire round? I pull mine out as Im walking up to my ball, usually while Im 20-30 yards away, I get positive satellite lock by the time Im standing over the ball, read my yardage and put the phone back to sleep. After putting I whip it out, score the entire foursome (takes about 15 seconds total) and then put it back to sleep. I consistently have 80-85% battery life after my round is complete.

Once we get side games/betting included in a future update I will be even more of a cheerleader for this app!   
////////////////////\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\Used Golfshot for my last 6 rounds and I will continue to use it forever! Its accurate, easy to use, and being able to email your scorecard to your buddies and review actual stats for yourself are perks I didnt know I wanted, but now I cant live without!

1959,3213,"This is a great app. Ive used ODB on my iPod Touch and then my iPhone before I got an iPad 2. Each version is more refined. I like the way that the app remembers my choice of Bible version (currently The Message) when I tap on the Scripture for the day. This isnt the case with the iPhone app. One always has to change the version from the default.

There are a couple formatting issue suggestions:

1. The poem at the bottom of the page is almost never formatted like the online website. It would be nice if the lines were stacked and not simply strung out in a row.
2. One of the things Ive always enjoyed are the cover photos. The cover for the current month shows in the upper righthand corner, but there is no way to enlarge it. One would think that a simple double-tap could bring up the cover art full screen?
3. When traveling I dont always have a wifi link, so having issues cached is nice. In those instances I simply use my Bible app (or print version) to get the Scripture for the day. I dont expect (or want) ODB to cache the Scripture from Biblegateway.com on my device, but it would be nice if there was a way in the app set-up to direct the ODB app to my Olivetree app onboard for the Scripture of the day. May be too difficult for what is already an elegant app.

149 rounds recorded. iPhone 3GS. Battery 70-80% left after rounds. Still no side game tracking but the notes feature works somewhat for that. Finally fivesomes! Sixsomes! THE BEST APP FOR GOLF!

17 rounds under my belt with this app now and still very happy. The new in-app stats (v.1.3) blew me away!  Still waiting for side games (skins, etc.). Im confused why so many golfers leave their phone on the entire round? I pull mine out as Im walking up to my ball, usually while Im 20-30 yards away, I get positive satellite lock by the time Im standing over the ball, read my yardage and put the phone back to sleep. After putting I whip it out, score the entire foursome (takes about 15 seconds total) and then put it back to sleep. I consistently have 80-85% battery life after my round is complete.

Once we get side games/betting included in a future update I will be even more of a cheerleader for this app!   
////////////////////\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\Used Golfshot for my last 6 rounds and I will continue to use it forever! Its accurate, easy to use, and being able to email your scorecard to your buddies and review actual stats for yourself are perks I didnt know I wanted, but now I cant live without!

2632,1115,"This is a great app. Ive used ODB on my iPod Touch and then my iPhone before I got an iPad 2. Each version is more refined. I like the way that the app remembers my choice of Bible version (currently The Message) when I tap on the Scripture for the day. This isnt the case with the iPhone app. One always has to change the version from the default.

There are a couple formatting issue suggestions:

1. The poem at the bottom of the page is almost never formatted like the online website. It would be nice if the lines were stacked and not simply strung out in a row.
2. One of the things Ive always enjoyed are the cover photos. The cover for the current month shows in the upper righthand corner, but there is no way to enlarge it. One would think that a simple double-tap could bring up the cover art full screen?
3. When traveling I dont always have a wifi link, so having issues cached is nice. In those instances I simply use my Bible app (or print version) to get the Scripture for the day. I dont expect (or want) ODB to cache the Scripture from Biblegateway.com on my device, but it would be nice if there was a way in the app set-up to direct the ODB app to my Olivetree app onboard for the Scripture of the day. May be too difficult for what is already an elegant app.

149 rounds recorded. iPhone 3GS. Battery 70-80% left after rounds. Still no side game tracking but the notes feature works somewhat for that. Finally fivesomes! Sixsomes! THE BEST APP FOR GOLF!

17 rounds under my belt with this app now and still very happy. The new in-app stats (v.1.3) blew me away!  Still waiting for side games (skins, etc.). Im confused why so many golfers leave their phone on the entire round? I pull mine out as Im walking up to my ball, usually while Im 20-30 yards away, I get positive satellite lock by the time Im standing over the ball, read my yardage and put the phone back to sleep. After putting I whip it out, score the entire foursome (takes about 15 seconds total) and then put it back to sleep. I consistently have 80-85% battery life after my round is complete.

Once we get side games/betting included in a future update I will be even more of a cheerleader for this app!   
////////////////////\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\Used Golfshot for my last 6 rounds and I will continue to use it forever! Its accurate, easy to use, and being able to email your scorecard to your buddies and review actual stats for yourself are perks I didnt know I wanted, but now I cant live without!

I have the iPhone 4, and only uses about half the battery during a 4 1/2 to 5 1/2 hour round. Turn off your Wi-fi if it is using more battery life than that.

Update to a month and a half later.

The UI is a little clunky, and things like tapping in the golf ball icon to measure club distance were a little tough to find. It doesnt look like a button.

Wish I could view the clubs and look at their performance without starting a round.

Time tables are pretty accurate, but what I love are the service advisories that constantly change every weekend and the neighborhoods maps, not to mention the last minute emergencies on lines due to a water main break or police incident or what have you. Better to plan your trip to avoid a certain line rather than find out at the station when yellow tape is blocking your way, and you have to walk a half mile to catch another line and find out the same thing before saying SOD it and catching a cab.

3687,1770,"I have the app on my phone and iPad I turn first to them for hotel and dining recommendations at home or in some exotic destination We do 2-4 major trips a year Ive seen hotels rated a 4 that in my opinion were really a 5 If you read the most current reviews you will get the best feel for the hotel Dining is more subjective and the rating dont always meet my expectations Again look for the ones written in the last few days An extra I really like are the street maps and metro guides Very hard to get lost if you use their guide Very easy to find how to get to your destination Overall, the guides are the best travel tools one could use",RT,DShEhBJWRV,2020-03-19,5
